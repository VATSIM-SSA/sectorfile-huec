===== HUEN Pilot Briefing =====

Pilots taking part in events that depart from or arrive to HUEN should make themselves familiar with this briefing page as well as with all existing charts.

===== Overview (Cross Africa) =====

===== Departure Timeline =====
When connecting to the network, take care in observing which gates and parking positions are available.

Due to limited stand capacity at HUEN, we kindly ask that you use the following stands/terminals based off the type of flight you are doing:
  * Passenger (Main Terminal)
  * Cargo (Apron 2/VIP Terminal)
  * Private (Apron 3/Apron 4)
  * Jumbo Aircraft, all types (Apron 1)


If needed, departing aircraft can spawn in another apron if a stand at the designated apron is unavailable. Arriving aircraft may also be subject to stand changes, and will be issued by the GND controller.

=== Pushback and Departure ===

  * For Cross Africa flights, your slot time is represented as a CTOT (Calculated Take off Time).
  * You'll be expected to push-back at TOBT (Target Off Block Time) between 10 and 15 minutes before CTOT (depending on how the traffic is flowing at that time).
  * As far as Clearance is concerned, you can request it at any time before TOBT, as long as you'll be ready for push-back at TOBT. We suggest you request your clearance at least 15 minutes before TOBT.
  * You should not need to connect to the network more than 60 minutes before your CTOT.

=== Clearance Delivery ===

  * HUEN_GND will be the Position responsible for providing you with a Departure Clearance.
  * For Cross Africa flights, pilots may be given a Cruise Flight Level that allows for en-route separation. It might not match your Requested Flight Level.
  * Pilots should expect an APNAD departure out of Entebbe, for both runways.

=== Departure Operations ===

  * Comply with your assigned departure procedure and do not climb above your initial Climb Altitude unless instructed so.
  * You may be given intermediate climb instructions due to traffic. Do not climb above any assigned flight level.
  * Comply with any speed restrictions if provided. They are important to maintain adequate separation between traffic.

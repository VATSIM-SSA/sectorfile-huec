===== HUEN Coordination =====

===== Cross Africa =====
The specific flight levels that handoffs will occur between Approach and Centre is as follows:

  * Departing (FL140)
  * Arriving (FL150)

All arriving aircraft should be FL150 by the first arrival fix, with arriving aircraft ideally handed off before the arriving point.

Any directs or further initial climb requests should be coordinated. In all ideal situations, it should be recommended that all departing and arriving aircraft are kept on the SID/STAR procedure, and managed my speed and altitude, and only taken off if needed for separation purposes.

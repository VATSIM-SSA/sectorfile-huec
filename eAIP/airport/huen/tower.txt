==== Runway Selection ====

  * Runway 17 is the preferred active runway, up to 10 kts of tailwind. 

==== Runway Change Operations ====

  * Runway changes must be coordinate with existing GND, TWR, DEP and APP controllers.
  * If possible, hold aircraft on stand before a runway change operation.
  * If an aircraft is already taxying on Twy G, offer the pilot the option to use the existing active Rwy or to enter the runway for taxiway direction change.
  * If an aircraft as already passed an approach IAF fix, an APP or TWR controller should advise the pilot of the possibility of a runway change prior to the aircraft being on the final approach segment.

==== Missed Approach Procedures ====

==== HIRO ====

  * When HIRO Ops are in effect, Tower Controllers will only handover traffic to Ground Controllers after issuing initial taxi instructions to pilots to avoid runway exit congestion.
  * If possible, Tower Controllers should advise pilots on which exit they should expect to vacate.
